<div align:center style="text-align:center"><img src="MobileMockUp.png" /></div>

This is a real eCommerce website for a tattoo and piercing shop.

## Getting Started

Well, just visit the website at [komorebi-alpha.vercel.app](https://komorebi-alpha.vercel.app/) and get yurself a cool earring!

### Q&A

We have used Trello as a work control tool and to report failures and bugs in the code. It is a good tool, especially because it is free and allows us to do our work, in good conditions.

We have also used Selenium for automatic tests and page stress tests. Here I leave a sample of what this application is capable of.
